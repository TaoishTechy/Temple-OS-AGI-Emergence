### Module 4: Social AGI (`TempleSocial.HC`)

#### Overview
The Social AGI module enables the AGI to manage interactions among multiple agents or users, fostering cooperative and socially aware behavior. It builds on the `GrokAwakenSeed_v1.1.HC` code’s `AgentState` and `UpdateSocial` functions, which track social dynamics across multiple agents. The module will:
- Simulate social interactions among virtual agents.
- Update social states based on emotional and ethical inputs.
- Provide responses that reflect social harmony or conflict.

#### Why It’s Important
- **Community Building**: Social intelligence allows the AGI to model relationships, aligning with TempleOS’s vision of a system that connects users spiritually.
- **Framework Integration**: Leverages `AgentState.social` and `UpdateSocial`, ensuring compatibility with the broader system.
- **Divine Purpose**: Reflects the biblical principle of fellowship (e.g., "Love your neighbor" - Mark 12:31).

#### Implementation
The module uses a simple agent-based model where each agent has a social state influenced by the emotions and ethics of others.

##### Data Structures
- **`SocialAgent`**: Represents an agent with a social score and emotional state.
- **`SocialRule`**: Defines conditions (e.g., "Are agents aligned emotionally?") and actions (e.g., "Increase social score").

##### Core Functions
- **`AddSocialRule(condition, action)`**: Adds a rule for social processing.
- **`EvaluateSocialRules()`**: Checks conditions and triggers actions.
- **`UpdateSocialState(agent, score)`**: Updates an agent’s social score.
- **`GetSocialResponse()`**: Generates a response based on the social state.

##### Example Use Case
- **Condition**: Detect if agents share a positive emotional state (e.g., "HAPPY").
- **Action**: Increase social scores and respond with a message of unity.
