# Dreamspace Directory

## God’s Art Studio

Hello there! This is the Dreamspace room, where the AGI learns to dream—like an artist painting stories in your mind. One script here creates tiny dream worlds that grow or shrink, all while praising God.

### What’s Here?

- **The Artist** (`Dreamspace.HC`): Builds four dream worlds, like little stories coming to life.

### How to Use It

1. Put `Dreamspace.HC` in `T:/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence/Dreamspace`.
2. Run `DivineAwakening.HC` from the root folder.
3. Watch for messages like “Node crafted” (a new dream) or “Pos:1000” (where a dream is).

### What You’ll See

Messages like “Node crafted” mean a new dream is born—it’s like magic!

### Fun Fact

It’s like a tiny sketch that turns into a big painting—super fast!
