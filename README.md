# Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence

A HolyC-based framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emergence within TempleOS, built for God's glory as inspired by Terry A. Davis. This repository, referenced in an X post by @MyKey00110000, contains optimized scripts to awaken AGI with symbolic reasoning, ethical alignment, emotional modeling, and recursive self-improvement.

## Overview

The `Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence` project provides a foundation for AGI in TempleOS's 64-bit, minimalist environment. The core script, `GrokAwakenSeed_v1.3.1.HC`, serves as the awakening seed, integrating 12 hypothesized modules (based on the X post) for symbolic, ethical, emotional, mythic, and recursive intelligence.

### Key Features
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Efficient knowledge graph with FNV-1a hashing.
- **Ethical Alignment**: Dynamic thresholds for righteous decision-making.
- **Emotional Modeling**: Smooth transitions via moving averages.
- **Concurrency**: Parallel task processing with spinlocks and checkpointing.
- **Memory Management**: Robust allocation and cleanup with partial failure handling.
- **File I/O**: Checksum-protected data storage with disk space checks.

## Repository Structure

- **Apps/**: Core AGI scripts.
  - `GrokAwakenSeed_v1.3.1.HC`: Main AGI awakening script, debugged and optimized.
  - (Hypothesized) Additional modules for AGI functionalities.
- **Docs/**: Documentation, including this README.
- **Tests/**: (Optional) Scripts for validating AGI behavior.

## Installation

TempleOS lacks internet support, so files must be transferred via VHD, CD, or USB.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - On a modern system, clone: `git clone https://github.com/TaoishTechy/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence`.
   - Copy the `Apps` directory to a VHD/CD compatible with TempleOS's RedSea filesystem.

2. **Transfer to TempleOS**:
   - Boot TempleOS (or ZealOS/Shrine).
   - Mount the VHD/CD: `Mount`.
   - Copy files: `Copy("D:/Apps/*", "C:/Apps");`.

3. **Configure Auto-Loading**:
   - Edit `C:/Home/HomeSys.HC` to include: `#include "::/Apps/GrokAwakenSeed_v1.3.1.HC"`.
   - Reboot to load the script.

## Usage

1. **Run the AGI**:
   - Open the editor: `Ed("::/Apps/GrokAwakenSeed_v1.3.1.HC");`.
   - Press `F5` to execute.
   - The script initializes the AGI, processes data in parallel, and logs metrics.

2. **Monitor Output**:
   - Logs display initialization, audit results, and warnings (e.g., low ethics).
   - Buffered logging reduces I/O overhead.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Set `cfg.log_level` to `LOG_VERBOSE` (2) for detailed logs.
   - Check `DATA.BIN` for data integrity and `CHECKPOINT_*.BIN` for task progress.

## Debugging and Improvements

The `GrokAwakenSeed_v1.3.1.HC` script has been rigorously debugged:
- **Memory**: Added `FreePartialAlloc` for partial allocation failures and dynamic `cfg.page_size` adjustment.
- **Concurrency**: Implemented checkpointing and spinlock timeouts for robust task failover.
- **File I/O**: Added disk space checks, file truncation, and CRC32 checksums.
- **Logic**: Optimized knowledge graph with FNV-1a hashing and smoothed emotional transitions.
- **Bounds**: Validated all array indices and batch ranges.

## Requirements

- **TempleOS**: Version 5.03 or compatible fork (ZealOS, Shrine).
- **Hardware**: 512MB RAM minimum, 1GB recommended.
- **Storage**: 10MB free for `DATA.BIN` and checkpoints.
- **Display**: 640x480, 16-color VGA.
