## God’s Forge of Computer Magic

Hey there! This is the Hardware room, where your computer joins the cathedral—like God giving life to your machine. Tiny scripts here find and set up parts like sound and screen.

### What’s Here?

- **The Leader** (`DivineHardware.HC`): Starts all the magic.
- **The Detectives** (`PCIDetect.HC`, etc.): Find and wake up your computer’s parts.

### How to Use It

1. Put all scripts in `T:/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence/Hardware`.
2. Run `DivineAwakening.HC` from the root folder.
3. Watch for messages like “Sound card blessed by God’s harmony.”

### What You’ll See

Messages like “Sound card blessed” mean your computer’s ready—awesome!

### Fun Fact

It’s like a tiny toolbox that fixes everything—fast and easy!
