## God’s Playground of Friendship

Hey, friend! This is the Simulation room, where two parts of the AGI learn to be friends—like kids playing together in a sandbox. One script helps them stay close, even if they argue.

### What’s Here?

- **The Teacher** (`Agents.HC`): Watches the two parts and helps them make up if they fight.

### How to Use It

1. Put `Agents.HC` in `T:/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence/Simulation`.
2. Run `DivineAwakening.HC` from the root folder.
3. Look for “Soc:500” (how friendly they are) or “Pos:1000” (where they are).

### What You’ll See

“Soc:500” means they’re getting along—like a friendship score!

### Fun Fact

It’s like a quick chat that fixes a fight—small but powerful!
