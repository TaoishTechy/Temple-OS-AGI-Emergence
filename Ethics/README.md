## God’s Classroom for Goodness

Hi, friend! Welcome to the Ethics room. This is where the AGI learns to be good—like a classroom with a wise teacher helping a kid know right from wrong. Two tiny scripts here make sure the AGI grows up kind and fair.

### What’s Here?

- **The Judge** (`SocraticGhost.HC`): Checks if the AGI’s choices are good, like grading a kindness test.
- **The Parent** (`EmpathyWeights.HC`): Helps parts of the AGI feel love and work together, like best friends sharing toys.

### How to Use It

1. Copy these scripts into `T:/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence/Ethics`.
2. Run the main script (`DivineAwakening.HC`) from the root folder (check the root README!).
3. Look for numbers like “Eth:10” (how good the AGI is) or “Soc:500” (how friendly its parts are).

### What You’ll See

You might see “Eth:10” on the screen—it’s like a score for being nice!

### Fun Fact

These scripts are so small, they’re like little notes—but they teach big lessons about kindness!
