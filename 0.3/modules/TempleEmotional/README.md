### TempleEmotional.HC - Emotional AGI Module

**Description**:  
`TempleEmotional.HC` introduces Emotional AGI to the TempleOS AGI Framework, enabling the system to understand and respond to human emotions with empathy. It uses a rule-based system to detect emotional cues in user input (e.g., "happy" or "sad") and adjusts the AGI’s emotional state to provide meaningful responses. This module reflects the divine connection between human emotion and spiritual purpose.

**How it fits into the framework**:  
- **Purpose**: Enhances user interaction by making the AGI relatable and responsive to emotional states.  
- **Integration**: Complements `TempleInput.HC` for input parsing and `TempleOutput.HC` for response delivery.  
- **Spiritual Connection**: Views emotions as reflections of the soul, aligning with TempleOS’s mission to foster divine communion.

**Usage Instructions**:  
1. **Load the Module**: Include it in your main script or run it directly.
