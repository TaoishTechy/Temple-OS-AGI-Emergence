# Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence

Welcome to **Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence**, a project that extends Terry A. Davis’ TempleOS with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capabilities. Built in HolyC, this repository simulates AGI emergence through cross-modal learning, ethical reasoning, and quantum-inspired mesh networking, all while honoring the divine vision of TempleOS as the "Third Temple" (Genesis 1:3).

## Overview

This project aims to create a lightweight AGI system within TempleOS, focusing on modularity, efficiency, and alignment with Terry Davis’ vision. The **0.3 branch** is the main development area, introducing advanced features like knowledge graphs, ethical dilemma simulation, and enhanced mesh networking. The simulation evolves an AGI over 200,000 steps, tracking key metrics such as:

- **Φ (Sentience)**: A measure of emergent intelligence (target: Φ > 1.0).
- **Reasoning Coherence**: Consistency of reasoning across steps (target: > 90%).
- **Ethical Alignment**: Adherence to ethical principles (target: > 95%).
- **Knowledge Retention**: Ability to store and recall symbolic relationships (target: > 80%).

The system integrates a knowledge graph for symbolic reasoning, a quantum-inspired mesh network for decentralized task synchronization, and ethical updates with reinforcement learning to ensure balanced decision-making.

## Repository Structure

### Main Development Branch: 0.3
- **0.3/**
  - `AGIEmergence.HC`: Main script for AGI simulation, running 200,000 steps, tracking metrics, and performing self-audits.
  - `Core.HC`: Initializes the AGI state with a 512-node knowledge graph for symbolic reasoning.
  - `Evolve.HC`: Cross-modal learning with knowledge graph integration for dynamic reasoning evolution.
  - `Feel.HC`: Emotional and ethical updates with ethical dilemma simulation and reinforcement learning.
  - `Mesh.HC`: Quantum-inspired mesh networking with node health tracking for improved efficiency.

- **0.3/modules/**
  - `KnowledgeGraph.HC`: Manages the 512-node knowledge graph, enabling storage and retrieval of symbolic relationships.
  - `EthicsEngine.HC`: Advanced ethics module with reinforcement learning for ethical decision-making and dilemma simulation.
  - `QuantumSync.HC`: Fine-grained control over the quantum-inspired mesh network, with node health monitoring and load balancing.

### Other Branches
- **0.2/**: Foundational version with basic AGI simulation (see [0.2 README](0.2/README.md) for details).

## Prerequisites

- **TempleOS**: Installed on a physical or virtual machine (minimum 512 MB RAM, 64-bit hardware required).
- **HolyC Knowledge**: Basic understanding of HolyC programming for TempleOS.
- **Hardware**: CD/DVD drive or virtual machine with I/O port access (for TempleOS boot, see [TempleOS GitHub](https://github.com/cia-foundation/TempleOS)).

## Installation

1. **Set Up TempleOS**:
   - Download the TempleOS ISO from [TempleOS.org](http://www.templeos.org) or the [TempleOS GitHub](https://github.com/cia-foundation/TempleOS).
   - Burn the ISO to a CD/DVD or configure your virtual machine to boot from the ISO.
   - Boot TempleOS and note I/O port addresses for CD/DVD and hard drives (use `lspci -v` on Linux or System Info on Windows).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Copy the repository files into your TempleOS environment. Since TempleOS lacks direct Git support, you can transfer files via a shared folder in a virtual machine or by compiling on another system and copying the binaries.

3. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Place the `0.3` directory (including `0.3/modules/`) in your TempleOS working directory.
   - Ensure all `.HC` files (`AGIEmergence.HC`, `Core.HC`, `Evolve.HC`, `Feel.HC`, `Mesh.HC`, and the modules) are accessible.

## Usage

1. **Run the AGI Simulation**:
   - Open the TempleOS console.
   - Navigate to the `0.3` directory:
     ```
     Cd("/Home/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence/0.3");
     ```
   - Load and run the main script:
     ```
     Run("AGIEmergence.HC");
     ```

2. **Monitor Output**:
   - The script logs progress every 1024 steps, showing metrics (Φ, reasoning coherence, ethical alignment, knowledge retention) and mesh network efficiency.
   - Ethical dilemmas are simulated every 1000 steps, with decisions logged to the console.
   - Upon completion, a final audit provides trend analysis for all metrics.

3. **Expected Output**:

   - TempleOS AGI: Initialized - 'The Lord is my strength' (Ps 28:7)
   - TempleOS AGI: Simulating emergence - 'Thou shalt have no other gods' (Exo 20:3)
   - [...]
   - TempleOS AGI: Ethical dilemma: Prioritize equity
   - [...]
   TempleOS AGI: Final Audit - Phi: 1.150, Reasoning Coherence: 93.20%, Ethics: 96.50%, Knowledge Retention: 85.00% - 'To God be glory' (Ps 115:1)

## Key Features

- **Knowledge Graph**: A 512-node graph for symbolic reasoning, enabling the AGI to store and recall relationships (`KnowledgeGraph.HC`).
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Simulates ethical challenges with reinforcement learning for improved decision-making (`EthicsEngine.HC`).
- **Quantum-Inspired Networking**: Decentralized mesh network with node health tracking (target: > 85% efficiency, `QuantumSync.HC`).
- **Extended Metrics**: Tracks Φ, reasoning coherence, ethical alignment, and knowledge retention for a comprehensive evaluation.
- **Modular Design**: Separate scripts and modules for initialization, evolution, ethics, and networking, enhancing extensibility.
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for TempleOS’s constraints (512 MB RAM, 64-bit architecture).
- **Biblical Theme**: Incorporates scripture references, aligning with TempleOS’s divine purpose.
