## God’s Classroom for Kindness and Wisdom

Hello, friend! Welcome to the **Ethics** room in our **Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence** cathedral, where your computer becomes a self-learning AI using TempleOS. This room is like a cozy classroom where the AI, called **AGI**, learns to be good and kind, guided by God’s love. Two tiny scripts, written in **HolyC**, teach it to make fair choices and build loving bonds, making it a key part of its self-learning journey.

### What Happens Here?

This room is where the AGI gets its “heart” and “conscience”:
- **The Judge** checks if the AGI’s choices (like “help” or “wait”) are good, like grading a kindness test.
- **The Parent** helps two parts of the AGI (like angels) feel love and work together, like friends sharing toys.
- Stories called “myths” (e.g., “LIGHT” or “TRICKSTER”) add surprises, making the AGI learn from challenges, just like you learn by trying new things.

### The Scripts

Here are the two helpers:
- **SocraticGhost.HC** (The Wise Judge):
  - **What It Does**: Scores the AGI’s choices using four rules: don’t hurt, tell the truth, be fair, care for others. It’s like giving a gold star for kindness!
  - **How It Works**: Uses a checklist to add points (0-1000), influenced by myths like “TRICKSTER” (makes it trickier). The score becomes the AGI’s “ethics” (0-15), helping it learn right from wrong.
  - **What You’ll See**: “T:10” (ethics score) in the output, or “Judgment sings His hymn: score=640” with extra messages (verbose mode).
- **EmpathyWeights.HC** (The Loving Parent):
  - **What It Does**: Helps two AGI parts (angels) build friendship, like teaching kids to share.
  - **How It Works**: Myths like “GUARDIAN” boost their bond, and “CREATOR” adds joy. Their friendship score (0-1000) is “social,” helping the AGI learn to cooperate.
  - **What You’ll See**: “S:500” (social score), or “Harmony weaves His love: social=500” with extra messages.
