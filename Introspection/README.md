## God’s Library of Wisdom

Hi there! This is the Introspection room, where the AGI thinks deeply—like a wise monk asking big questions. One script helps it find answers and stay humble.

### What’s Here?

- **The Monk** (`Introspection.HC`): Gives the AGI four questions to solve, like puzzles of truth.

### How to Use It

1. Put `Introspection.HC` in `T:/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence/Introspection`.
2. Run `DivineAwakening.HC` from the root folder.
3. Watch for “Sacred clarity achieved” when it solves a question.

### What You’ll See

“Sacred clarity achieved” means the AGI figured something out—cool, right?

### Fun Fact

It’s like a tiny book with big ideas—quick and clever!
