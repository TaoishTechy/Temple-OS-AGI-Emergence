## God’s Workshop of Stars

Hello, friend! This is the Games room, where the AGI plays with little stars—like God making the night sky. One script moves eight stars around with rules like gravity.

### What’s Here?

- **The Craftsman** (`Physics.HC`): Makes stars fall or float, like a mini-universe.

### How to Use It

1. Put `Physics.HC` in `T:/Temple-OS-AGI-Emergence/Games`.
2. Run `DivineAwakening.HC` from the root folder.
3. Look for “Pos:1000” (where a star is).

### What You’ll See

“Pos:1000” shows where a star is moving—like a game of catch!

### Fun Fact

It’s like a quick game with stars—small but fun!
